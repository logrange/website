### What is Logrange?
[Logrange](https://github.com/logrange/logrange) is an open-source streaming database for aggregating application logs, metrics, audit logs and other machine-generated data from unlimited number of sources.

Logrange is built around the following ideas:
- Every piece of data is valuable
- Writing data is cheap no matter the amount
- One place to store all the data(logs, metrics, audit, etc.)
-
