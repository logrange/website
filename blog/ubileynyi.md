We are excited to announce the next release of [Logrange](https://www.github.com/logrange/logrange). This release is timed to my Birthday, so we called it "Ubileynyi" (anniversary one).

### What is Logrange?
[Logrange](https://github.com/logrange/logrange) is an open-source streaming database for aggregating application logs, metrics, audit logs and other machine-generated data from an unlimited number of sources.

Logrange is built upon the following principles:
- Every piece of data has its value
- Writing data is inexpensive, regardless of volume It’s convenient to have
- One place for storing data(logs, metrics, audit, etc.)
- Store first, process later

### What's in this release
Not too much is here yet. We fixed several bugs related to pipes and some corner case scenarios. Collector can timestamping records by the time it reads them from a log-file. 

Of course, you can build it from [source](https://github.com/logrange/logrange)
