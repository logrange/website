### Introducing Logrange v0.1.0
We are excited to announce our first official release of [Logrange](https://www.github.com/logrange/logrange). Logrange has been developing for last several months, and now it is available for aggreating application logs and some features for their processing. 

Along with the version, we released the integration of Logrange into [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/) by [Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com/)

### What is Logrange?
[Logrange](https://github.com/logrange/logrange) is an open-source streaming database for aggregating application logs, metrics, audit logs and other machine-generated data from thousands of sources.

Logrange is built around the idea that every piece of data is essential. Logrange keeps different types of machine-generated data in one database, what makes it a great source for comprehensive the data analysis.

Logrange strives to achieve the following goals:
- Persisting streaming data should be cheap. All data is important, so it should be saved in a full amount for later processing.
- All data is in one database. Logrange provides an API for uniform access to the data collected from thousands of different sources. 
- To provide tools for the aggregated data further learning and analysis to build an advanced features like AI for the distributed system health.
- Logrange is open-source and secure, to meet high quality standards for transferring, saving and processing data.
- Could be run everywhere either in Cloud or On-Premise configurations.
- Easy to run and configure.

### What is in the release
The release contains the following components:
- _log collector_ allows to scan log-files on a host-machine(s), sending the into Logrange's database. 
- _log aggregator_ is Logrange server. It accepts writes data into the database and provides an API to serve client's requests.
- _log shell_ is Logrange's CLI tool, which allows to make requests to the database using  [LQL](link) (Logrange Query Language)
- _log forwarder_ allows to send data from Logrange database into a 3rd party system using _Rsyslog_ protocol

Logrange is availiable in the following configurations: 
- _Standalone_. In the configuration all components can be run manually. Try [quick start](https://github.com/logrange/logrange#quick-start) to see how it works.
- _Kubernetes_. Logrange can be deployed as a log-aggregation system into a Kubernetes cluster. You can find how to run Logrange in Kubernetes [here](https://github.com/logrange/k8s) .

Logrange binaries are avialable for Linux and MacOs platforms on our [Download](link) page. You can run Logrange components either in a cloud or on-premises using hosted, virtualized or conteinerized soultions or a mix of them.

Of course, you can build it from [source](https://github.com/logrange/logrange)

### Gravitational starts to use Logrange for Gravity!
[Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com/) starts to use Logrange for serving cluster logs infrastructure in [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/), their flagship product! Logrange's component are deployed into the Gravity cluster for aggregating the cluster's application logs and providing an interface for working with them. There are 2 main use-cases Logrange addresses in Gravity:
1. Aggergating logs from the applications, that run in the Gravity cluster. Providing an inteface for search and downloading collected logs.
2. Forwarding aggregated logs to a 3rd party system using [Rsyslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsyslog) protocol.

Here is what Sasha Klizhentas (CTO of Gravitational Inc.) says about it:

> [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity) uses Logrange to collect and aggregate log data in the most restricted environments and provides
> our customers with ability to search, retain and forward logs to external log storage without compromising on security or storage.

### The future
Logrange is under active development. Our plan is to continue working on the following items:
- To support HA (High Availability). Logrange will be run as a cluster of machines
- To provide more CLI features for working with logs.
- To support log-storage to meet high-end security standards
- To provide more integrations with Logrange database. Better data visualization and forwarding it to 3rd party system.
- To work on data-analysis tools that allow to build Anomalies Prediction solutions using collected machine-generated data.
